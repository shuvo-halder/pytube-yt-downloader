# Python YouTube Video Downloader
Pytube Overview and Installation.
Pytube is a small, dependency-free Python module for accessing videos from the internet.

The native library is not pytube—you must first install it to use it. When you have pip, installation is simple.

To install Pytube using pip, you will need to open your command prompt CLI as an administrator and enter the following command:
```bash
$ pip install pytube
```
The pytube library improves video downloads. Build the YouTube module's object by supplying the URL as a parameter. Then, obtain the video's proper extension and resolution. You can change the file's name at your leisure; otherwise, the original name will be retained.

### How to use:-
Download or clone the git repository
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/shuvo-halder/pytube-yt-downloader.git
```
Go to your git clone or download folder then
```bash
$ python3 main.py 
```
```bash
~ Enter the YouTube video URL:
```

Now Enjoy...
